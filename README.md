## Installation
> You need to have `typescript` installed in your project
```bash
npm install minform
yarn add minform
pnpm add minform
bun add minform
```





## Motivation

There are a lot of **powerful** validation packages out there but sometimes you don't need all that power, you just need something simple and lightweight for your simple forms.
